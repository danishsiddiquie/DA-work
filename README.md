# New York City vehicle collission data project

### Description 

The R markdown I have uploaded uses an open source New York Motor Vehicle Accidents Data set, acquired from 
(http://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) website. The code consists of basic analysis
of data, with a visual of accidents occurring in each Borough in New York City. Although the rmd file is present for the analysis, the data itself is too big to be uploaded, and thus the link above can be used to obtain the data.

### Prerequisites

The programs that I used to work through this project is:

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) in [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) - visualizing and cleaning of data


### Installing

In order to install Rstudio you will first need to install R. You can install R  and you can use any of the versions to install it onto your computer. After you install R you should install Rstudio which is an inferface to code in R (we have installed the free version).
